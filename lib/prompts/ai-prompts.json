The keywords must be derived from the specific concepts, keywords, and evidence sentences provided for each end of the axis.\n5. The two keywords should define a coherent \"spectrum of variation\" or \"thematic tension.\"\n6. Compare and contrast the \"Negative End\" context with the \"Positive End\" context to find the most meaningful conceptual difference.\n7. Use professional, architectural, and conceptually meaningful language in a {{STYLE_PRESET}} tone for {{CORPUS_DOMAIN}}.\n8.
