# SemiChan Interpretation Guide: Understanding the Hybrid Model

This guide helps you interpret the results of the SemiChan pipeline, focusing on how the system balances meaning and literal wording to create the final visualization.

## Chapter 1: The Core - Semantic vs. Frequency

At the heart of SemiChan is the **Hybrid Fingerprint**. Every sentence a juror speaks is converted into a mathematical representation that exists in two "layers" simultaneously.

### 1. The Semantic Layer (The "Meaning")
*   **What it is:** A vector representation generated by a neural network (Transformer).
*   **What it captures:** The underlying concept, intent, and "vibe."
*   **Example:** It knows that "the room is too dark" and "insufficient natural light" are semantically identical, even though they share no common words.
*   **In the Graph:** High semantic weight pulls jurors together based on **shared themes**.

### 2. The Frequency Layer (The "Literal")
*   **What it is:** A BM25 frequency vector based on specific N-grams (word pairs and triplets).
*   **What it captures:** Precise architectural terminology and unique phrasing.
*   **Example:** It tracks the specific use of terms like "sun path," "CLT construction," or "R-value."
*   **In the Graph:** High frequency weight pulls jurors together based on **shared vocabulary**.

## Understanding "Overlap" and Divergence

In SemiChan, we analyze how these two layers interact. While they often point to the same conclusion, their **divergence** is often the most interesting part of the analysis.

### What is Overlap?
Overlap occurs when a juror's **literal wording** aligns perfectly with the **standard meaning** of a concept.
*   **The "Standard" Juror:** Uses clear, industry-standard terms to describe common concepts.
*   **Interpretation:** This juror's feedback is "unambiguous." They are saying exactly what they mean using the vocabulary the system (and other jurors) expects for that topic.
*   **Graph Behavior:** They appear as "anchor" points, strongly connected to the center of a concept node.

### What is Divergence (Non-Overlap)?
Divergence occurs when the "What they said" (Frequency) and "What they meant" (Semantic) don't align. This usually happens in two ways:

#### A. Unique Expression (High Semantic, Low Frequency Overlap)
*   **Scenario:** The juror is talking about a common theme (like "Circulation") but using poetic, idiosyncratic, or non-technical language.
*   **Interpretation:** This juror has a unique perspective or a different way of articulating common problems. They are "conceptually aligned" but "lexically unique."
*   **Graph Behavior:** They might float in the "neighborhood" of a concept but with thinner links or a more isolated position.

#### B. Technical Jargon (Low Semantic, High Frequency Overlap)
*   **Scenario:** The juror uses many technical buzzwords that appear in other concepts, but the actual *intent* of their sentence is about something else.
*   **Interpretation:** This can signal "noise" or a juror who is touching on many technical aspects without a single clear conceptual focus.
*   **Graph Behavior:** They may be pulled toward multiple concepts simultaneously, appearing between them in the 3D space.

## How to Interpret the Weights

You can control the "Interpretation Lens" using the Feature Weight sliders:

| If you increase... | The graph focuses on... | Best for... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic Weight** | Broad themes and conceptual "vibes." | Finding general consensus and high-level project themes. |
| **Frequency Weight** | Specific terminology and technical details. | Identifying jurors who are talking about the exact same technical components. |

**Pro Tip:** If you see jurors who seem isolated, try shifting the weights. If they suddenly "snap" to a concept when you increase Semantic Weight, it means they are talking about that theme, just in their own unique way.

## Understanding Network Logic: Density and Strictness

You can control how "busy" or "clean" the visualization is using the Network Logic settings:

### 1. Link Density (Filtering "Noise")
*   **What it is:** Controls the visibility of connections between jurors and concepts.
*   **Minimalist (0%):** Only shows a juror's primary focus. Clears out the background noise.
*   **Exploratory (100%):** Shows every minor interest and secondary comment, creating a complex web.
*   **When to use:** Use **Minimalist** for clean presentations; use **Exploratory** when hunting for unexpected patterns.

### 2. Similarity Bar (The "Strictness" Bar)
*   **What it is:** Sets the bar for how similar two jurors or concepts must be to be connected.
*   **Broad (0%):** Connects anything with even a vague resemblance. 
*   **Strict (100%):** Only connects things that are nearly identical in their feedback.
*   **When to use:** Use **Broad** to see general "neighborhoods" of ideas; use **Strict** to find people who are in total agreement.

## The Interpretation Presets

We provide quick presets to help you jump between common analytical perspectives:

### Interpretation Lens (Meaning vs. Wording)
*   **Meaning:** Focuses on conceptual alignment (90% Semantic).
*   **Wording:** Focuses on technical terminology (90% Frequency).
*   **Balanced:** Equal parts intent and literal wording.
*   **Precision:** High-density mode for finding exact duplicates in both meaning and phrasing.

### Network Logic (The Structural View)
*   **Summary:** High strictness, high filtering. Only the core, undeniable themes remain.
*   **Standard:** The balanced "Golden Mean" for most data.
*   **Discover:** Low filtering; reveals subtle secondary links.
*   **Full Web:** Raw data view; every nuance and tiny connection is visible.

## Understanding the 3D Space: Axis Labels

In the 3D graph visualization, nodes are positioned using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduces high-dimensional semantic vectors to three spatial coordinates (X, Y, Z). The axes represent the **primary dimensions of variation** in your corpus.

### What Do the Axes Mean?

Each axis represents a **spectrum** between two conceptual poles:

*   **X-Axis:** The primary dimension of variation (most variance in the data)
*   **Y-Axis:** The secondary dimension of variation
*   **Z-Axis:** The tertiary dimension of variation (up/down in the 3D view)

### How Axis Labels Work

Axis labels identify the concepts at the extremes of each axis, showing you what dimensions your data varies along:

*   **Negative End (Left/Bottom/Back):** The concept with the minimum coordinate value on that axis
*   **Positive End (Right/Top/Front):** The concept with the maximum coordinate value on that axis
*   **Synthesized Label (Optional):** An AI-generated label that captures the semantic relationship between the two extremes

**Example:** If the X-axis shows "Lighting" ↔ "Structure", this means:
*   The primary way concepts differ in your corpus is along a lighting-to-structure dimension
*   Concepts related to lighting cluster toward the negative (left) side
*   Concepts related to structure cluster toward the positive (right) side
*   A node's X-position tells you how much it leans toward lighting concerns vs. structural concerns

### Interpreting Spatial Position

*   **Nodes close together** share similar semantic profiles across all dimensions
*   **Nodes far apart** represent different thematic focuses
*   **Axis position matters:** A node's position along an axis tells you where it falls on that particular spectrum
*   **Jurors near concepts** have strong association with those themes

**Key Insight:** The axes don't have inherent semantic meaning on their own—they're mathematical directions. But by labeling the extremes, we transform the "black box" of PCA into an interpretable map of your conceptual landscape.

## Understanding the Node Anatomy: Roots and Identity

When you select a node in the 3D graph, you will see "roots" or "tendrils" growing out of it. These are a high-fidelity visualization of the **Identity Distribution** and **Contribution Weight** of the jurors connected to that node.

### 1. Root Colors: Matching Juror Identity
Unlike the node itself, which uses a blended color to represent its general "profile," the roots are **multicolored**.
*   **Direct Identity Match:** Each color in the root system corresponds exactly to a Juror's color in the "Jurors" sidebar tab. 
*   **Visual Fingerprint:** If you see a concept node with a "rainbow" of different colored roots, it means many different jurors are contributing diverse perspectives. If the roots are overwhelmingly one color, it means a single juror is the primary "owner" of that concept.

### 2. Branching Density: The "Weight" Map
The "thickness" and "complexity" of the roots are programmatically tied to the **Contribution Weight**:
*   **Proportional Count:** The number of root "trunks" for a specific color is proportional to that juror's weight. If the sidebar shows a juror has 50% contribution, 50% of the roots will be their color.
*   **"Bushiness" (Sub-branching):** Stronger contributors have "bushier" roots with more secondary and tertiary branches. Minor contributors appear as thin, single tendrils.
*   **Deterministic Shuffling:** Colors are scattered evenly around the node surface so that the "tapestry" of contributors is visible from any camera angle.

## The Color Language of Feedback: Stance

While the roots tell you **who** is talking, the colors of the **link lines** and the **stance badges** in the inspector tell you the **intent** of the feedback:

*   <span style="color:#16a34a">●</span> **Green (Praise):** Positive feedback, validation, or successful elements.
*   <span style="color:#dc2626">●</span> **Red (Critique):** Negative feedback, identified failures, or "pain points."
*   <span style="color:#f59e0b">●</span> **Orange (Suggestion):** Constructive advice, requested changes, or future possibilities.
*   <span style="color:#64748b">●</span> **Slate (Neutral):** Purely descriptive observations or factual statements.

**Key Insight:** A concept node with mostly **Red** links but a diverse set of **Multicolored Roots** indicates a "universal pain point"—something that many different jurors (identities) agree is a problem.

## Spatial Shapes: Jurors vs. Concepts

To help you navigate the 3D space, we use distinct geometries for different entity types:

*   **Spheres (Concepts):** Represent semantic clusters and themes. Their size indicates the total volume of feedback associated with that idea.
*   **Dodecahedrons (Jurors):** Represent individual people. They are shaped like complex geometric "crystals" to signify unique human perspectives.
