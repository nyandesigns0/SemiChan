# SemiChan Interpretation Guide: Understanding the Hybrid Model

This guide helps you interpret the results of the SemiChan pipeline, focusing on how the system balances meaning and literal wording to create the final visualization.

## Chapter 1: The Core - Semantic vs. Frequency

At the heart of SemiChan is the **Hybrid Fingerprint**. Every sentence a juror speaks is converted into a mathematical representation that exists in two "layers" simultaneously.

### 1. The Semantic Layer (The "Meaning")
*   **What it is:** A vector representation generated by a neural network (Transformer).
*   **What it captures:** The underlying concept, intent, and "vibe."
*   **Example:** It knows that "the room is too dark" and "insufficient natural light" are semantically identical, even though they share no common words.
*   **In the Graph:** High semantic weight pulls jurors together based on **shared themes**.

### 2. The Frequency Layer (The "Literal")
*   **What it is:** A BM25 frequency vector based on specific N-grams (word pairs and triplets).
*   **What it captures:** Precise architectural terminology and unique phrasing.
*   **Example:** It tracks the specific use of terms like "sun path," "CLT construction," or "R-value."
*   **In the Graph:** High frequency weight pulls jurors together based on **shared vocabulary**.

## Understanding "Overlap" and Divergence

In SemiChan, we analyze how these two layers interact. While they often point to the same conclusion, their **divergence** is often the most interesting part of the analysis.

### What is Overlap?
Overlap occurs when a juror's **literal wording** aligns perfectly with the **standard meaning** of a concept.
*   **The "Standard" Juror:** Uses clear, industry-standard terms to describe common concepts.
*   **Interpretation:** This juror's feedback is "unambiguous." They are saying exactly what they mean using the vocabulary the system (and other jurors) expects for that topic.
*   **Graph Behavior:** They appear as "anchor" points, strongly connected to the center of a concept node.

### What is Divergence (Non-Overlap)?
Divergence occurs when the "What they said" (Frequency) and "What they meant" (Semantic) don't align. This usually happens in two ways:

#### A. Unique Expression (High Semantic, Low Frequency Overlap)
*   **Scenario:** The juror is talking about a common theme (like "Circulation") but using poetic, idiosyncratic, or non-technical language.
*   **Interpretation:** This juror has a unique perspective or a different way of articulating common problems. They are "conceptually aligned" but "lexically unique."
*   **Graph Behavior:** They might float in the "neighborhood" of a concept but with thinner links or a more isolated position.

#### B. Technical Jargon (Low Semantic, High Frequency Overlap)
*   **Scenario:** The juror uses many technical buzzwords that appear in other concepts, but the actual *intent* of their sentence is about something else.
*   **Interpretation:** This can signal "noise" or a juror who is touching on many technical aspects without a single clear conceptual focus.
*   **Graph Behavior:** They may be pulled toward multiple concepts simultaneously, appearing between them in the 3D space.

## How to Interpret the Weights

You can control the "Interpretation Lens" using the Feature Weight sliders:

| If you increase... | The graph focuses on... | Best for... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic Weight** | Broad themes and conceptual "vibes." | Finding general consensus and high-level project themes. |
| **Frequency Weight** | Specific terminology and technical details. | Identifying jurors who are talking about the exact same technical components. |

**Pro Tip:** If you see jurors who seem isolated, try shifting the weights. If they suddenly "snap" to a concept when you increase Semantic Weight, it means they are talking about that theme, just in their own unique way.
